Download server modpacks at [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks), look under `files`. The default download is the client. I'm not sure all have the same layout, some are just a simple file with references to plugins which the itzg server can read. Note also that the itzg server has a config option for forcing its own simpler start-script `USE_MODPACK_START_SCRIPT: "false"`

See [DockerHub itzg server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server) and its [documentation at GitHub](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/blob/master/README.md#running-a-server-with-a-curseforge-modpack).
