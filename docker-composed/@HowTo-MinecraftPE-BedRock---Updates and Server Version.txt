2022.05 I now manually update minecraft app on Maya and Nadias primary tablets, and on server. 
The BedRock server version is defined in 
  exec-minecraft:
   BEDROCK_VERSION="1.18.33.02"

Update strategy
* Backup server manually
	 zip -r bedrock-nadia-venner-before-update.zip bedrock-nadia-venner
* Update Minecraft app phone/old-tablet and server
* Test it works, then update main tablets


Notes
* Bedrock Server might be out of sync with latest available. Also Bedrock server updates sometimes introduce errors that make it unplayable.
  It is probably best to manually manage the Bedrock Version, and only update on server when client has been updated.
