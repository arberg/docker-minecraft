Update strategy
* Run upgradeDockerCurrentDir-to-latest-with-backup.sh
    which executes '../exec-minecraft updateToLatest'
    - this takes a backup and then updates to latest version
* Update Minecraft app on phone or old-tablet (alex-phone or lisas smaller phone)
* Test it works, then update main tablets
* Update exec-minecraft.sh: BEDROCK_VERSION

Husk: Jeg har ogs√• natlig backup i UserScripts til /mnt/user/sync/MinecraftServerSync

Notes
* Bedrock Server might be out of sync with latest available. Also Bedrock server updates sometimes introduce errors that make it unplayable.
  It is probably best to manually manage the Bedrock Version, and only update on server when client has been updated.
